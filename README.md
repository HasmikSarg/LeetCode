# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repo has my solutions to various LeetCode problems, all written in Java. Each problem lives in its own folder with the Java solution file and a README explaining what the problem is about.

## ‚úÖ Solved Problems

### 1. 53. Maximum Subarray  
**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray with the largest sum and return that sum.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum of 6.
```

### 2. 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
**Difficulty:** Easy

You're given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on the *i*-th day. You want to maximize your profit by picking one day to buy and a different future day to sell. Return the max profit you can get. If you can't make any profit, return 0.

**Example:**
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
```

### 3. 152. Maximum Product Subarray  
**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product and return that product. The test cases guarantee the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product of 6.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

To compile and run any of these Java solutions:

### 1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
```

### 2. Go to the problem folder you want:  
Example:
```bash
cd LeetCode-0aa310c2618bc02fc1237c4e2020412914899540/0053-maximum-subarray
```

### 3. Compile the Java file:
```bash
javac Solution.java
```

### 4. Run the solution:  
These solutions are meant to run on LeetCode's platform. To test them locally, you'll need to add a `main` method to the `Solution` class with some test cases.

**Example `main` for Maximum Subarray:**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Solution sol = new Solution();
    int[] nums1 = {-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4};
    System.out.println("Max Subarray Sum for [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]: " + sol.maxSubArray(nums1)); // Expected: 6
    
    int[] nums2 = {1};
    System.out.println("Max Subarray Sum for [1]: " + sol.maxSubArray(nums2)); // Expected: 1
}
```

### 5. After adding the `main` method, compile and run:
```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```
